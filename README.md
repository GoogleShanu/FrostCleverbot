# Frost (Cleverbot)
An extremely simple Discord cleverbot

If you want **Frost** on your server, just use the following link:<br>
ðŸ”— **https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=197531129434210304&scope=bot&permissions=3072**

If you're interested in running it yourself, the requirements are:

* Python 3.5 or higher
* Discord.py (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
* A bot account (https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
* A Cleverbot.io API User and API Key (https://cleverbot.io/keys)

Then, just add your token at the bottom of the file, and your user and key near the top!

### Notes
Ah, cleverbot. Why did you have to become [a paid service](https://www.cleverbot.com/api/)? Well, it's honestly no surprise, considering how many Discord bots used the cleverbot features. Hopefully cleverbot.io can perform as well, and maybe even get a little bit smarter.
